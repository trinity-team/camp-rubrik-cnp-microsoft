# Objective: Manage Databases

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

* Live Mount a SQL Server Database
* Unmount a SQL Server Database

This section presents new recovery methods that take database management to another level. The instructions focus on Microsoft SQL, however, please note that similar functionality (database Live Mount) is available for Oracle.

## **Getting Started**

Databases are at the heart of the data management strategy for all enterprises. This is because critical applications are built and hosted on databases—both relational and non-relational—so any downtime on databases has a direct impact on the company’s revenue. Rubrik is committed to delivering value to our customers by simplifying their data management strategies across all environments.

Live Mount also allows customers to quickly clone their production database onto an alternate host but with the added benefit of not having to copy files, eliminating the need to provision any storage for database clones.
