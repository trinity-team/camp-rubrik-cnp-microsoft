# Inventory Walkthrough

Polaris' simple user interface is built on a API-driven framework with a HTML5 web user interface. To see it for yourself:

Once you have accessed the Camp Rubrik lab environment, select the **Jump1** Host and authenticate using the following OS credentials:

* Username: `demo@rubrik.lab`
* Password: `Welcome10!`

Open up the web browser (Chrome) and browse to the Polaris URL specified in the jumpbox credentials tray. Log in using the credentials specified below the Polaris URL.

Once authenticated, the Rubrik UI will default to the **Clusters** page. Letâ€™s explore the **Inventory** page.

The **Inventory** page provides a high-level overview of the types and quantities of workloads protected by source. This include cloud, saas, and data center workloads.

Click on **Azure** to display the Azure VMs discovered in the existing subscription.

Use the **Resource Group** filter to filter the inventory down to the `prod` Resource Group whose name contains your Oasis lab id. This id can be found inside the jumpbox credentials tray. In this guide we will be using `oasis` as the lab id.

The **Inventory** page now shows only the VMs associated with your lab environment. Click on the **VM name** that matches `your_lab_id-win-vm-1`. The **Overview** page for this vm appears. Here you can see manny details about the vm, its protection status, and an unpopulated snapshot calendar view.
