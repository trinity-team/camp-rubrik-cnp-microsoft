A **Configure Cloud Conversion** dialog will appear, in which you may toggle the choice between:

* Auto Convert Latest Snapshot - Keep One
* Auto Convert Latest Snapshot - Keep All

This configuration results in the latest snapshot being converted into a cloud image, for example, a VHD. This image can be used to spin up as many instances of the workload as desired.
