# Objective: Unleash the Power of Hybrid Cloud

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

* Navigate CloudOut archival functionality
* Explore CloudOn and Cloud Conversion options
* Understand Cloud-Native Protection

This section will provide you the opportunity to explore some of the Rubrik functionality for public cloud. This section provides more of an overview rather than a guided lab experience. 

## **Getting Started**

The word nephology means the study or contemplation of clouds. Rubrik enables enterprises to utilize public cloud (e.g. Microsoft Azure) or private cloud for all aspects of data management â€“ backup, replication and DR, archival, test/dev, and more. Backups can be used to convert VMs into cloud instances for on-demand application migration and cloud test/dev. 

Rubrik Polaris Cloud-Native Protection can be used to protect and manage applications such as Microsoft Office 365, Azure VMs, and cloud databases.
