# Envision

Rubrik Envision provides customizable data protection reports with valuable information from the Rubrik cluster. Envision gives insight into historical information based on Protection Tasks, SLA Compliance, and System Capacity.

You can explore Envision in two formats:

* Reports Summary
* Reports Gallery

In the **Reports Summary** you can view or create individual reports in the Daily Protection Tasks by Status, SLA Compliance, Local Snapshot Storage, System Capacity, or Weekly Protection Tasks by SLA Domain sections. Letâ€™s explore that section:

In the Rubrik UI, in the left-hand pane, select **Reports** > **Summary**.

The Protection Tasks Details page appears.

Scroll down to **System Capacity** and you will notice: On Brik, Available Storage, Archived, Average Daily Growth, Across All Replicas, and Estimated Runway.

One of the most critical details here is the **Estimated Runway** that reports the estimated number of days remaining before additional data storage space is required on the Rubrik cluster. This is a critical metric to have available on any system that leverages data reduction combining incremental forever, deduplication, and compression.

The **Protection Tasks Details** page appears. Scroll down to where you can **Search by Object Name** and supply dynamic filters.

Type **`win`** to search for all objects that have been protected with the word **`win`** in it.

* Daily Backup Administrator Report (You will create this one)
