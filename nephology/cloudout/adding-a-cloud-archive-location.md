Review the different inputs required for **Microsoft Azure** as an archive. Feel free to browse other archive types to view required settings.

Press **Cancel** when finished.

On the left pane of the web UI, select **SLA Domains** > **Local Domains**. The Local SLA Domains page appears.

Select the Camp Rubrik SLA Domain that you previously created. The SLA Domain page will load.

Click the ellipses (`...`) at the top right corner of the SLA Domain page. Select **Edit**.

Click Next to view the Set Archiving and Replication pane.

In Archival, click the toggle (if not already done). Notice the **Enable Instant Archive** option. Do not select it at this time although you can click the circled “`i`” to read what it does.

The Instant Archive feature can be enabled to instruct a Rubrik cluster to immediately queue a task to copy a new snapshot to a specified archival location.

Press **Cancel**.
