# Use Cases

The use cases for a published, open, and documented API are endless. A few common customer use cases include:

* **Self-Service Automation** - Integrate with your favorite IT service management (ITSM) tool or service portal, such as ServiceNow or vRealize Automation. Leverage your ticketing system to assign SLA Domains, perform restores, or monitor your backups. You can even build your own custom dashboards. One of Rubrikâ€™s service delivery providers created their own service portal offering completely by themselves using only Rubrik API documentation.
* **Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management** - Use automation tools like Ansible, Terraform, Puppet, and SaltStack to set up, configure, and update the Rubrik platform. Simplify your infrastructure into just a few lines of code. Customers use Rubrik APIs to deploy and bootstrap Edge instances at remote locations, create and manage SLA Domains, and automate recovery processes. 
* **Centralized Monitoring & Logging** - Eliminate console hopping and use the same observability services to monitor your data protection solution. Easily integrate with Nagios, Prometheus, Splunk, vRealize Log Insight, and more. This allows you to manage Rubrik monitoring, logging, and alerting with the same tools you already use across your environment.
* **Test Automation** - Rubrik can be used to accelerate application test and development by instantly providing multiple copies to developers without a storage penalty. With Rubrik, users can integrate Live Mount functionality into test automation continuous integration (CI) workflows for virtualized, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle environments.
* **Command-Line Management and Scripting** - Customers enjoy command-line interaction with Rubrik through the use of rbkcli and PowerShell. Commands can be used to target specific configurations or workloads with ease. Use simple commands or scripts to automate repetitive tasks easily.
