## **Getting Started**

Every good explorer needs a set of tools to navigate the mountainous terrain of files and folders. Rubrik provides filesets as a simple tool for organizing and protecting your files and folders whether on Linux, Windows, AIX, Solaris hosts and servers, or NAS shares. Rubrik filesets are purpose-built for quickly locating and recovering your critical files or folders when urgency strikes.
