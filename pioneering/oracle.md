# Oracle

Rubrik offers the same protection for Oracle as Microsoft SQL. Oracle backups are preserved in an immutable format and managed via the same Rubrik policy that applies to all other datasets. Live Mount enables near-zero RTOs to ensure organizations are able to recover from an outage in near instant fashion. A virtual read-write copy of Oracle data files is generated on-demand and served directly to the production Oracle host via NFS. Rubrikâ€™s Live Migration capability enables Oracle data files to be migrated back to production while Oracle database files are still being actively served by the Rubrik cluster, thus eliminating additional downtime.
