# Dashboard Walkthrough



Rubrik’s simple user interface is built on a API-driven framework with a HTML5 web user interface. To see it for yourself:

Once you have accessed the Camp Rubrik lab environment, select the **Jump1** Host and authenticate using the following OS credentials:

* Username: `demo@rubrik.lab`
* Password: `Welcome10!`

Open up the web browser (Chrome) and select the shortcut for the Rubrik UI. Login using the following credentials:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `Welcome10!Rubrik`

Once authenticated, the Rubrik UI will default to the **Dashboard** page.

Let’s explore the various Dashboard panes.

The **vSphere VMs** pane provides a high-level overview of how many vSphere objects are protected by an SLA Domain.

Click on **vSphere VMs** to display the dropdown box that allows you to view a protection overview by workload type.

Towards the middle of the Dashboard screen, you can see the number of active **Live Mounts** as well as the number of **Incoming Snapshots**.

At the bottom, you are able to get a quick peek at the number of snapshots residing on this Rubrik cluster, percent data reduction using deduplication and compression, and amount of data archived.
