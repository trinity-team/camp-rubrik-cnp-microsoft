The **Overview** pane provides information regarding the object’s location, configuration for CloudOn (if configured), the SLA Domain applied, Oldest and Latest Snapshot, total snapshots, etc. This can vary depending on location and type of machine. On the right-hand side there is a **Snapshots** calendar view. The next few steps will guide you on your journey to explore this more.

**Trail Map:**

_Download_ - Rubrik cluster generates download links to use for file level restore (FLR) of files and folders, making it available to download locally to the user's device.

_Overwrite original_ - files and folders restored directly to a guest file system of the protected workload whether a VM, physical server, or NAS share. This will overwrite the existing files on the machine.

_Restore to separate folder_ - files and folders restored to a folder of your choosing.

_Export_ - allows you to restore files and folders to a different machine.

In the Rubrik UI, locate the **Search by File Name** in the **Snapshots** view and type in the word `hosts` to locate the file.
