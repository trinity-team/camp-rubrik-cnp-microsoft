# Create an SLA Domain

To create an SLA Domain:

On the left-hand navigation pane, select **SLA Domains &gt; Local Domains**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Trail Map:**

_Local Domain_ - an SLA Domain that is created on the local Rubrik cluster.

_Remote Domain_ - an SLA Domain that was created on a Rubrik cluster other than the local Rubrik cluster. Remote SLA Domains appear on a local Rubrik cluster when the local Rubrik cluster is a replication target.

**Trail Map:** Continuous Data Protection enables you to protect your high value applications, running on vSphere, with near-zero RPOs. With CDP, you can recover from local or remote points in time with near zero RPOs for recovery from the latest point in time, or per-second granularity for recovery from historical points in time.
{% endhint %}

Select **Next** to configure replication and archive in the Remote Settings portion of the SLA Domain.
