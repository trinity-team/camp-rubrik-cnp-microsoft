# Objective: Search and Recover Files

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

* Search for a VM
* Search for a file
* Recover a file via download

Backups are one of the most – if not the most – important defense against ransomware. Rubrik’s uniquely immutable filesystem natively prevents unauthorized access or deletion of backups, allowing IT teams to quickly restore to the most recent clean state with minimal business disruption. With a Google-like search, Rubrik eliminates the search complexity inherent in legacy solutions by introducing consumer-grade file search that delivers query results instantly. This allows you to easily recover your data in the event of disaster.

## **Getting Started**

As you type your query, Rubrik expedites the query by displaying suggested search results with auto-complete functionality. The user can instantly locate specific versions of files across time and locations for all VMs, applications, and file systems - no matter where the data resides (on-premises or in the cloud).
